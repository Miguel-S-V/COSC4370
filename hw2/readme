HW2
Compiled with make file note that in problem 4 my submission has the triangle drawn as specifed in the HW however i could not get it to display
a certain color. Even after calling the method to draw them. Furthermore it was the closest i could get to the artiuclated hand 
other than that the rest should resemble the images closely.
